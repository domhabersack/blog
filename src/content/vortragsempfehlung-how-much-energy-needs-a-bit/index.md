Special-Lecture: Prof. Dr. techn. Dr. h. c. Josef A. Nossek

Abstract:

– Old challenges – Research work concentrated on improving the spectral efficiency (GSM — UMTS — LTE — LTE/A — …) – New challenges – Overall energy efficiency is as important as spectral efficiency – Consider the total energy of the physical layer (transmit as well as the dissipation within the equipments) – Characterize the trade-off between spectral efficiency and the overall energy efficiency – Exploit physical limits of multi-antenna systems
